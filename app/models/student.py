    Student model — represents a student enrolled in the college.

    OOP Concepts:
    ──────────────
    1. INHERITANCE: extends BaseModel
    2. ONE-TO-ONE with User (COMPOSITION):
       A Student IS-A User. If the User is deleted, the Student is also deleted.
       This is Composition — Student cannot exist without User.
    3. MANY-TO-ONE with Department (AGGREGATION):
       A Student belongs to a Department, but the department exists independently.
    4. ONE-TO-MANY with Attendance, Marks, Fees (COMPOSITION):
       Attendance/Marks/Fees belong to a student.

    Linked to departments table via department_id (MANY-TO-ONE).
