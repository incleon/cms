    Department model — represents an academic department.

    OOP Concept: AGGREGATION
    ─────────────────────────
    Department HAS students and teachers, but they can exist
    independently (a teacher can be reassigned to another department).
    This is Aggregation, not Composition.

    Relationships:
    - ONE-TO-MANY: Department → Students
    - ONE-TO-MANY: Department → Teachers
    - ONE-TO-MANY: Department → Subjects
    - MANY-TO-ONE: Department → HOD (a teacher who heads the dept)
