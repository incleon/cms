"""
Models Package
===============
Import all models here so that:
1. Alembic can discover them for migrations
2. SQLAlchemy's Base.metadata has all tables registered
3. Relationships between models are properly resolved

This demonstrates the PACKAGE PATTERN — grouping related
modules and providing a clean public API.
